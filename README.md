# Coffee Sales Dashboard
## *Project Overview*
Through this Microsoft Excel project, I developed an interactive dashboard on Microsoft Excel that cleans and organizes a Kaggle dataset on various coffee products. This allows users to filter through categories and timelines to present trends on three graphs: "Total Sales Over Time", "Sales by Country", and "Top 5 Customers."<br/>
Questions to consider:<br/>  
1. Which country has the most coffee sales by date? 
2. Who are the top customers that contributed to the most sales within a certain time period?
3. Which coffee type has the most sales over time?<br/>

After completing the dashboard, I learned that from 2021 to 2022:<br/> 

1. United States have the most sales with up to $35,639.
2. The top one most paying customer is Allis Wilmore who contributed $317 in coffee sales.
3. Liberica has a 0.36% higher sales rate compared to Arabic, which makes it the highest total sales over time.
