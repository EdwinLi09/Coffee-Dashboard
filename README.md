- Determine each different Coffee types on their sales and analyze the various trends on each sale.
- I also applied advanced formulas to merge datasets into a data chart, and utilized pivot tables, slicers, and a timeline to enhance dashboard visualization.
- Can filter through each category, including the timeline, to present different trends on the three graphs that are titled "Total Sales Over Time", "Sales By Country", and "Top 5 Customers".
1. Which country has the most coffee sales?
2. Who are the top customers within a certain time period?
3. Which coffee type has the most sales over time?
