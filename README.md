# Coffee Sales

Through this excel project, I analyzed sales trends for different coffee types, merged datasets into a data chart using advanced formulas, and enhanced dashboard visualization with pivot tables, slicers, and a timeline. This allows filtering through categories and timelines to present trends on three graphs: "Total Sales Over Time", "Sales by Country", and "Top 5 Customers." With this, I was able to break down the datasets and answer the following questions: 
1. Which country has the most coffee sales by date? 
2. Who are the top customers within a certain time period?
3. Which coffee type has the most sales over time?
